        Deadpool (born who-knows-when, because he's too cool to care) is an
        iconic anti-hero, known for his sarcastic humor, fourth-wall-breaking
        antics, and relentless combat skills. Deadpool is a leading figure in
        the world of unconventional superheroes, with a massive fanbase who
        adore his chaotic energy.

        Originally a skilled mercenary named Wade Wilson, he gained his infamous
        regenerative healing factor after a highly questionable experiment. His
        adventures span across mercenary missions, comedic showdowns, and
        unexpected team-ups with the X-Men (even if they don’t always invite
        him). Deadpool has faced off against powerful villains while delivering
        non-stop quips, pop culture references, and, of course, maximum carnage.
        His story includes unforgettable battles, outrageous stunts, and the
        occasional taco break.

        With his signature red-and-black suit, dual katanas, and an arsenal of
        weapons, Deadpool continues to redefine what it means to be a "hero"—or
        at least, whatever suits him at the moment.
